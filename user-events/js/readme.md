Thrift vs Protocol Buffers in Javascript-land

Protocol buffers:

No in-built implementation. According to Protocol Buffers wiki there are three third-party implementations:

http://code.google.com/p/protobuf-js/  - looks immature
https://github.com/dcodeIO/ProtoBuf.js - looks interesting
http://github.com/sirikata/protojs     - looks interesting

Due to time constraints, I only evaluated ProtoBuf.js


Thrift:

Javascript is very verbose.
Generated at compile time.
